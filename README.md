==============

  This repository has experimental changes to the OAX code. Changes such as:

* Alternate third-person camera (WIP)
* Stretched spark particles (buggy)
* Support for additional player animations (where supported by the player model)
* Loads MDR players
* Alternate death cameras (including the old Q2 firstperson tilted camera left unused in the game)
* New lightning bolt effect
* The original rail trail discs restored

    Please note that this repository is not currently based on the latest OAX code.  This is merely a place where my new changes are made and tracked for merging with OAX at a later time.
