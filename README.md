leixperimental
==============

  This repository has experimental changes to the OAX code. Changes such as:

* Alternate third-person camera (WIP)
* Stretched spark particles (buggy)
* Support for additional player animations (where supported by the player model)
* Loads MDR players
* Alternate death cameras (including the old Q2 firstperson tilted camera left unused in the game)
* New lightning bolt effect
* The original rail trail discs restored
* New third person mode
* Load sexy models if map calls for it
* Chibi mode
* Supports the renderer's new eye tracking feature
* The ability to view through your model's eyes

    Please note that this repository is not currently based on the latest OAX code.  This is merely a place where my new changes are made and tracked for merging with OAX at a later time.



TODO
====

* Experiment with implementing new gametypes (chicken catch, bombing run, environmental lms, invasion, etc)
* Integrate rfactory.org's scripted UI enhancements and features (neverminding the singleplayer stuff)
* Fix sparks
* Perhaps undo leiEnhancement entirely once there's a scripted particle system engine-side
